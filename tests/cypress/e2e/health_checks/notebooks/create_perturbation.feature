    Then I see material designer page
    And I import materials from Standata
      | name | index |
      | C, Graphene, HEX (P6/mmm) 2D (Monolayer), 2dm-3993 | 2 |
    Then material with following name exists in state
      | name | index |
      | C, Graphene, HEX (P6/mmm) 2D (Monolayer), 2dm-3993 | 2 |

    # Open
    When I open JupyterLite Transformation dialog
    Then I see JupyterLite Transformation dialog
    And I see file "Introduction.ipynb" opened
